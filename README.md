# PiCrust
A GoPiGo robot controlled with PiUi and Python for mobile devices.

The PiCrust script is set up to allow some basic control over the GoPiGo. It has buttons to move the GoPiGo forward and backward 3 revolutions and turn left or right (turning left will rotate more than turning right). It also has toggle switches for both of the front LEDs.
